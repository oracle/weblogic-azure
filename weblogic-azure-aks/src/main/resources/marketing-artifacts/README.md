<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offer enables you to embrace cloud computing by providing greater choice and flexibility for WLS migration. The offer enables you to move WebLogic workloads to AKS as quickly and easily as possible by automating the provisioning of a number of Java and Azure resources. The automatically provisioned resources include an AKS cluster, the WLS Operator, WLS Docker images, the Azure Container Registry (ACR). The offer also supports configuring load balancing with Azure App Gateway or the Azure Load Balancer, DNS configuration, SSL configuration, easing database connectivity, publishing metrics to Azure Monitor as well as mounting Azure Files as Kuberetes Persistence Volumes. Once the offer performs most boilerplate resource provisioning and configuration, you can focus on deploying your WebLogic application to AKS, typically through a DevOps tool such as GitHub Actions. You are also completely free to customize the deployment further.</p>
<p><i>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License</i>. It assumes you have already procured the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure.</p>
