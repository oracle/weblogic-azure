<p>Provisions an Oracle WebLogic Server dynamic cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service</p>
<h1>Short description</h1>
<p>Provisions an Oracle WebLogic Server dynamic cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service. Integration options include Azure App Gateway, Azure Load Balancer, Azure Container Registry, Azure Files, Azure Application Insights and various databases.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) Enterprise Edition on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offer lets you embrace cloud computing by providing greater choice and flexibility for WLS migration. The offer enables you to move WLS workloads to AKS as quickly and easily as possible by automating the provisioning of a number of Java and Azure resources. The automatically provisioned resources include an AKS cluster, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, WLS Docker images and the Azure Container Registry (ACR). It is possible to use an existing AKS cluster or ACR instance with the offer if desired.</p>
<p>This offer always deploys WebLogic Server using the 'Model in image' domain home source type. For more information on domain home source types, <a href="https://aka.ms/wls-aks-docs-domain-home-source-type">see the documentation from Oracle</a>.</p>
<p>The offer also supports configuring load balancing with Azure App Gateway or the Azure Load Balancer, DNS configuration, SSL/TLS configuration, easing database connectivity, publishing metrics to Azure Monitor as well as mounting Azure Files as Kubernetes Persistent Volumes. After the offer performs most boilerplate resource provisioning and configuration, you can focus on deploying your WLS application to AKS, typically through a DevOps tool such as GitHub Actions and tools from WebLogic Kubernetes tooling such as the WebLogic Image Tool and WebLogic Deploy Tooling. You are completely free to customize the deployment further.</p>
<p>Oracle and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on <a href="https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/azure-kubernetes-service/">getting started with WLS and AKS</a>. This guidance is suitable for customers that wish to remain as close as possible to a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience as an alternative to using a solution template.</p>
<p>In addition to the WLS on AKS offer, Oracle and Microsoft also provide similar offers targeting Azure virtual machines. The WebLogic on virtual machines offers address a range of scenarios such as single node with an admin server or WebLogic cluster. All offers are listed in the Useful links section at the bottom of the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/oracle.oraclelinux-wls-cluster">solution overview</a> page.</p>
<p><i>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License</i>. It assumes you have already procured the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure.</p>
