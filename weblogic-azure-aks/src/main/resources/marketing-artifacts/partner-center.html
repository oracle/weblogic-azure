<p>The Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) Enterprise Edition on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offer lets you embrace cloud computing by providing greater choice and flexibility for WLS migration. The offer enables you to move WLS workloads to AKS as quickly and easily as possible by automating the provisioning of a number of Java and Azure resources.</p>
<p>After deployment, you can use DevOps tool such as GitHub Actions to work with the cluster.</p>
<p>Oracle and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on <a href="https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/samples/azure-kubernetes-service/">getting started with WLS and AKS</a>. This guidance is suitable for customers that wish to remain as close as possible to a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience.</p>
<p>Oracle and Microsoft also provide similar offers targeting Azure virtual machines. The WebLogic on virtual machines offers address a range of scenarios such as single node with an admin server or WebLogic cluster.
