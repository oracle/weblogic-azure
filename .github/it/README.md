# IT Validation Configuration

## Overview

The IT validation system is a comprehensive integration testing framework designed to validate Oracle WebLogic Server deployments on Azure across multiple scenarios and configurations. It automates the execution of various deployment scenarios, monitors their progress, and generates detailed reports to ensure the reliability and quality of the Azure WebLogic templates.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Scenario Testing**: Execute multiple test scenarios simultaneously or sequentially
- **Flexible Execution Modes**: Support for both parallel and serial execution modes
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed reports with success/failure statistics and execution URLs
- **Automated Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of workflow execution with timeout protection
- **Resource Management**: Efficient cleanup and resource optimization for cost-effective testing

### Use Cases

- **Regression Testing**: Validate WebLogic templates after code changes or updates
- **Release Validation**: Comprehensive testing before production releases
- **Configuration Testing**: Verify different deployment configurations and parameters
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track deployment times and resource utilization

## System Architecture

The IT validation system consists of:

1. **Validation Plan Files** (this directory): JSON files defining what to test
2. **IT Action** (`/.github/actions/it/action.yml`): Reusable composite action that executes the plans
3. **IT Workflows** (`/.github/workflows/it-validation-*.yaml`): Workflows that trigger the action with specific plans
3. **Target Workflows** (`/.github/workflows/testWls*.yml` and `buildWls*.yml`): The actual validation workflows that get executed

## Configuration Structure

The validation plan files use the following structure:

### Scenarios Structure
Each validation plan defines scenarios with descriptive names:

```json
{
  "validation_scenarios": [
    {
      "workflow": "testWlsVmAdmin.yml",
      "run_mode": "serial",
      "scenarios": [
        {
          "scenario": "Test Admin Server on VM with mssqlserver",
          "inputs": {
            "location": "centralus"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Execution Modes

You can control how scenarios within a workflow are executed by using the optional `run_mode` property:

- **`"run_mode": "serial"`**: Scenarios are executed one after another. Each scenario must complete before the next one starts.
- **`"run_mode": "parallel"`** or **no `run_mode` specified**: Scenarios are executed simultaneously (default behavior).

**Example with serial execution:**
```json
{
  "validation_scenarios": [
    {
      "workflow": "testWlsVmCluster.yml",
      "run_mode": "serial",
      "scenarios": [
        {
          "scenario": "First scenario",
          "inputs": { /* ... */ }
        },
        {
          "scenario": "Second scenario",
          "inputs": { /* ... */ }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**When to use serial mode:**
- Resource-intensive scenarios that might conflict if run simultaneously
- Scenarios that need to run in a specific order
- Limited resource environments where parallel execution might cause failures

## How It Works

1. **IT Workflows**: The `it-validation-*.yaml` workflows are triggered (manually or scheduled)

2. **Plan File Mapping**: Each IT workflow maps its input to a specific validation plan file in this directory

3. **Action Execution**: The workflow calls the IT action (`/.github/actions/it/action.yml`) with the plan file path

4. **Plan Processing**: The action reads the validation plan and processes each scenario

5. **Execution Mode**: The optional `run_mode` property controls whether scenarios are executed serially or in parallel

6. **Workflow Triggering**: The action triggers the specified target workflows with the scenario inputs

7. **Monitoring**: The action monitors workflow execution and waits for completion

8. **Reporting**: Results are compiled into comprehensive reports and stored in the `it` branch

## Available Files

- `validation-plan-aks.json`: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) validation scenarios for WebLogic Server deployments
- `validation-plan-build.json`: Build-only validation scenarios for template compilation and syntax checking
- `validation-plan-vm-admin.json`: WebLogic Admin Server on VM validation scenarios
- `validation-plan-vm-cluster.json`: WebLogic Configured Cluster on VM validation scenarios  
- `validation-plan-vm-dynamic-cluster.json`: WebLogic Dynamic Cluster on VM validation scenarios

### File Content Overview

Each validation plan targets specific WebLogic deployment scenarios:

- **AKS Plans**: Test WebLogic Server deployments on Azure Kubernetes Service with various database configurations
- **VM Plans**: Test WebLogic Server deployments on Azure Virtual Machines in different topologies (Admin Server, Configured Cluster, Dynamic Cluster)
- **Build Plans**: Validate artifact compilation and template syntax without actual deployments

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Choose a Validation Plan**: Select the appropriate validation plan file based on your testing needs:
   - For AKS deployments: `validation-plan-aks.json`
   - For Admin Server on VM: `validation-plan-vm-admin.json`
   - For Configured Cluster on VM: `validation-plan-vm-cluster.json`
   - For Dynamic Cluster on VM: `validation-plan-vm-dynamic-cluster.json`
   - For build validation only: `validation-plan-build.json`

2. **Trigger IT Validation**: Use the GitHub Actions interface to manually trigger a IT validation workflow:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in the repository
   - Select the appropriate `it-validation-*` workflow:
     - `IT Validation for AKS` - for AKS deployments
     - `IT Validation for VM Admin` - for Admin Server on VM
     - `IT Validation for VM Cluster` - for Configured Cluster on VM  
     - `IT Validation for VM Dynamic Cluster` - for Dynamic Cluster on VM
     - `IT Validation for Build` - for build-only validation
   - Click "Run workflow" and select your desired validation plan

3. **Monitor Progress**: Track the execution progress in the Actions tab and view real-time logs

4. **Review Results**: Check the generated reports in the `it` branch under `it-report/` directory

### Prerequisites

Before using the IT validation system, ensure:

- [ ] Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- [ ] GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- [ ] Required secrets configured in repository settings. The repository secrets set by the [setup-credentials.sh](../workflows/setup-credentials.sh) script must be set with current and valid values before any of these workflows will run.
- [ ] Access to the `it` branch for report storage

## IT Action Usage

The validation plans are consumed by the IT action located at `/.github/actions/it/action.yml`. 

### Action Inputs

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `it_file` | Path to the validation plan file | Yes |

### Action Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `results` | JSON string containing the results of all workflow executions |
| `report_timestamp` | Timestamp of the generated report |
| `report_url` | URL to the generated report on the IT branch |

## Structure Requirements

- Each plan must have a `validation_scenarios` array
- Each item in the array must have a `workflow` and `scenarios` field
- Each scenario must have a `scenario` name and an `inputs` object
- The optional `run_mode` field can be set to `"serial"` or `"parallel"` (default)
- Only the `inputs` object content is passed to the target workflow

## Serial vs Parallel Execution

### Parallel Execution (Default)
- All scenarios within a workflow are triggered simultaneously
- Faster overall execution time
- Suitable for independent scenarios that don't compete for resources

### Serial Execution
- Scenarios are executed one after another
- Each scenario must complete before the next one starts
- Longer overall execution time but better resource management
- Includes waiting and monitoring between scenarios
- Recommended for resource-intensive workloads or debugging

## Report Generation

The IT action generates comprehensive reports that include:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total workflows, success/failure counts including cancelled and timeout scenarios
- **Detailed Results**: Individual workflow results with duration and status  
- **Execution URLs**: Direct links to workflow runs
- **Execution Notes**: Information about serial vs parallel execution

Reports are:
1. Uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts
2. Committed to the `it` branch in the `it-report/` directory
3. Accessible via the repository's IT branch

### Status Tracking

The system tracks all execution outcomes:
- **Success**: Workflows completed successfully
- **Failure**: Workflows failed during execution  
- **Timeout**: Workflows exceeded the 60-minute timeout limit
- **Cancelled**: Workflows manually cancelled by users
- **Other Failed**: Workflows with any other non-success status

### Accessing Reports

Reports can be accessed in multiple ways:

1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: Download reports directly from the workflow run artifacts
2. **IT Branch**: Browse reports in the `it` branch under `it-report/` directory  
3. **Direct Links**: Use the `report_url` output from the IT action
4. **API Access**: Programmatically access reports via GitHub API

#### Report File Naming Convention

Reports follow the naming pattern: `report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`

Example: `report-20250804-103000.json` (August 4, 2025 at 10:30:00 UTC)

## Error Handling

The IT action includes robust error handling:
- **Timeout Protection**: 60-minute maximum wait time per workflow
- **Failure Detection**: IT workflow fails if any triggered workflow fails, times out, or is cancelled

## Trouble Shooting

### Debugging with tmate

One of the biggest pain points to develop GitHub actions for our Java EE solution offerings is that it's hard to debug them by direct interacting with the host system on which the actual Actions are running.

I found a GitHub action `tmate` which unlocks the door for debugging GitHub actions using SSH or Web shell, pls refer to [Debugging with tmate](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate) or to the [tmate docs](https://mxschmitt.github.io/action-tmate/) for detailed how-to instructions.

And here is an example where `tmate` was applied in `integration-test` workflow of `liberty-on-aks` repo:
* https://github.com/WASdev/azure.liberty.aks/pull/62/files#diff-b6766eb8febc0c51651250cd0cdfb44c4f0d3256470d88e62bf82fd46aa73ae0R119-R121


## Authentication of the tmate session.
> Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/issues/163)’s [comment](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/issues/163#issuecomment-1651436411), 

this [action](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate) uses the ssh public key from the github account as `authorised_keys`.
So if you have multiple private keys in your local machine, you may need to specify the private key used for `*.tmate.io` in your `~/.ssh/config` file.
