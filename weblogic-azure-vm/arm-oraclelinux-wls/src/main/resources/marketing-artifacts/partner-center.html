<p>Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure virtual machines offers enable you to embrace cloud computing by providing greater choice and flexibility for WLS migration. The offers enable you to lift and shift WLS workloads to virtual machines as quickly and easily as possible. The goal of the offers is to minimize boilerplate work by automatically provisioning virtual network, storage and Linux resources, installing WLS, setting up security with a network security group, easing database connectivity, configuring load-balancing with App Gateway or Oracle HTTP Server, connecting to Azure Active Directory, enabling centralized logging via ELK as well as integrating distributed caching with Oracle Coherence. After the offers perform most boilerplate resource provisioning and configuration, you can focus on deploying your applications. You are completely free to customize the provisioned resources further.</p>
<p>There are a number of virtual machines based offers that support different common use cases such as a single working instance with Admin Server enabled as well as highly available clusters.</p>
<p>This specific offer provisions a single virtual machine and installs Oracle WebLogic Server Enterprise Edition on it. It does not create a domain or start the Administration Server, which is useful for scenarios with highly customized domain configuration. For complete instructions, please follow the <a href="https://aka.ms/wls-vm-docs">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This offer supports a range of operating system, Java and WebLogic versions such as WLS 14 and JDK 11 on Oracle Linux 7.6 through base images. These base images are also available on Azure on their own. The base images are suitable for customers that require very highly customized Azure deployments. The current set of base images are available <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=oracle%20weblogic%20base%20image&amp;page=1">in the Azure marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the WLS on virtual machines offers, Oracle and Microsoft also provide a similar solution targeting the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). All offers are listed in the Useful links section at the bottom of the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/oracle.oraclelinux-wls-cluster">solution overview</a> page.</p>
<p><i>These offers are all Bring-Your-Own-License</i>. They assume you have already procured the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure.</p>
