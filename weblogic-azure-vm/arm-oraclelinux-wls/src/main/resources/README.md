## Search results summary

Oracle WebLogic Server is a scalable, enterprise-ready Java application server.

## Description (Observed max 2973 characters, not including formatting)

<p>Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) on Azure offers enable you to embrace cloud computing by making it as easy as possible to migrate your Java applications to Azure. The offers increase productivity by automating most boilerplate Java and Azure resource provisioning and configuration tasks so that you can focus on application development. The offers cover deployment to both Azure Virtual Machines and the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).</p>

<p>The offers are linked in the <i>Learn more</i> section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>These offers are Bring-Your-Own-License. They assume you have already procured the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly licensed to run offers in Azure.</p>

<p><i>If you want to work closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing these offers, just hit the CONTACT ME button</i>. Program managers, architects and engineers will reach back out to you shortly and initiate collaboration!</p>

<p><b>WebLogic Server on Virtual Machines</b><br/>
The WebLogic Server on virtual machines offers automate provisioning virtual network, storage, and Linux resources, installing WLS, setting up security with a network security group, easing database connectivity, configuring load-balancing with App Gateway or Oracle HTTP Server, connecting to Azure Active Directory, enabling centralized logging via ELK as well as integrating distributed caching with Oracle Coherence.</p>

<p>There are several offers that target use cases such as single node with Administration server enabled and WLS cluster (including both configured and dynamic clusters). These offers supports a range of operating system, Java and WebLogic versions such as WLS 14.1.1.0 and JDK 11 on Oracle Linux through base images. These base images are also available on Azure on their own. The base images are suitable for customers that require very highly customized Azure deployments. The current set of base images are available <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=oracle%20weblogic%20base%20image&amp;page=1">in the Azure marketplace</a>.</p>

<p><b>WebLogic Server on AKS</b><br/>
The WebLogic Server on AKS offer automates provisioning an AKS cluster, the WebLogic Kubernetes Operator, WLS Docker images and the Azure Container Registry (ACR). The offer also supports configuring load balancing with Azure App Gateway or the Azure Load Balancer, easing database connectivity, publishing metrics to Azure Monitor as well as mounting Azure Files as Kubernetes Persistent Volumes. The offer will work with any WLS version that supports the Operator, such as 14.1.2.0, 14.1.1.0, and 12.2.1.4.</p>

<p>Oracle and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on <a href=” https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure/run-oracle-weblogic-server-on-azure-kubernetes-service/ba-p/1849719”>getting started with WLS and AKS</a>. This guidance is suitable for customers that wish to remain as close as possible to a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience.</p>
