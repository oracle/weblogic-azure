<h1>Short description</h1>
<p>Provisions an n-node Oracle WebLogic Server cluster on Azure VMs. Supports integration with Azure App Gateway, databases, and
Coherence.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Oracle WebLogic Server (WLS) is an industry-leading Java runtime powering some of the most mission-critical enterprise applications
   across the globe. This solution automates most boilerplate steps to provision a WLS cluster on Azure VMs. Once initial
   provisioning is complete, you are completely free to customize deployments further. The solution is jointly developed by Oracle and
   Microsoft.</p>
<p>WLS Enterprise Edition versions supported include 12.2.1.3, 12.2.1.4, and 14.1.1.0.</p>
<p>The following resources are automatically provisioned by the offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VMs (you can choose the number of VMs - all instances will have private
IP addresses by default)</li>
<li>Configured cluster consisting of WebLogic Managed Server instances on each VM (<strong>ORACLE_HOME</strong> is
<strong>/u01/app/wls/install/oracle/middleware/oracle_home</strong>)</li>
<li>Admin Server on one of the VMs</li>
<li>WLS Domain with default name <strong>wlsd</strong> (domain path is <strong>/u01/domains/wlsd/</strong>)</li>
<li>Oracle JDK on each VM (<strong>JAVA_HOME</strong> is <strong>/u01/app/jdk/jdk-${version}</strong>)</li>
<li>Azure App Gateway instance with a public IP address (the backend pool will be set to VMs running Managed Servers) - optional</li>
<li>In addition to drivers that come standard with WLS, most recent supported PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL JDBC drivers (drivers stored in
<strong>/u01/app/wls/install/oracle/middleware/oracle_home/wlserver/server/lib/</strong>)</li>
<li>Configured data source connection (Oracle DB, Azure SQL, Azure MySQL, Azure PostgreSQL) - optional</li>
<li>VMs with private IP addresses to run data tier Managed Coherence cache servers - optional</li>
<li>Azure Availability Set for the VMs</li>
<li>Virtual network and subnet (alternatively, you can deploy to an existing virtual network)</li>
<li>Network security group</li>
<li>OS disks attached to VMs</li>
</ul>
<p><i>This offer is Bring-Your-Own-License</i>. It assumes you have already procured the appropriate licenses with Oracle and are properly
licensed to run offers in Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>Oracle and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step instructions on getting started with WLS and Azure VMs without automated
provisioning.</p>
<p>Oracle and Microsoft provide similar solutions targeting WLS on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) in addition to a single WLS
Admin Server instance on an Azure VM. These options are linked in the <i>Learn more</i> section below.</p>
