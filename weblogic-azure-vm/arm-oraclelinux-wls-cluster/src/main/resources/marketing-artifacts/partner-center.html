<p>WLS on Azure virtual machines offers enable you to embrace cloud computing by providing greater choice and flexibility for WLS migration. The offers enable you to lift and shift WLS workloads to virtual machines. After provisioning, you can customize the resources and focus on deploying your applications.</p>
<p>Additional offers support different common use cases such as a single working instance with Admin Server enabled as well as highly available clusters.</p>
<p>This specific offer creates a highly available cluster of WLS Enterprise Edition virtual machines. The Administration Server and all managed servers are started by default, which allow you to manage the domain with a browser. For complete instructions, please follow the <a href="https://aka.ms/wls-vm-docs">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This offer supports a range of operating system, Java and WebLogic versions such as WLS 14 and JDK 11 on Oracle Linux 7.6 through base images. These base images are also available on Azure on their own. The base images are suitable for customers that require very highly customized Azure deployments. The current set of base images are available <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?search=oracle%20weblogic%20base%20image&amp;page=1">in the Azure marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the WLS on virtual machines offers, Oracle and Microsoft also provide a similar solution targeting the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). All offers are listed in the Useful links section at the bottom of the <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/oracle.oraclelinux-wls-cluster">solution overview</a> page.</p>
